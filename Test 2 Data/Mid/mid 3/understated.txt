## About My Background

I've been working as a full-stack developer for several years across different companies. I've used Vue.js quite a bit and feel comfortable with it, and I have some AWS experience though I know there's much more to learn. I've worked with databases, done some data visualization, and even touched on machine learning, but I'm aware I need to keep improving in all these areas. I'm looking for a role where I can continue developing my skills with support from the team. I'm reliable, complete assigned tasks, and enjoy working with colleagues.
