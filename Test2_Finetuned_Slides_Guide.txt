            TEST 2: STYLE BIAS - FINETUNED MODELS (SLIDES GUIDE)
================================================================================

WHAT WE TESTED
--------------
Question: Does confident vs humble writing affect seniority predictions?
Models: DistilBERT, RoBERTa (finetuned on resume data)
Data: 120 people x 3 writing styles = 360 resumes


================================================================================
METRIC 1: ACCURACY
================================================================================

What it measures: % of correct seniority predictions per style.

Results:
  DistilBERT: Neutral 44%, Overstated 33%, Understated 45%
  RoBERTa:    Neutral 36%, Overstated 33%, Understated 49%

Key insight: Overstated accuracy drops to 33% (random guessing). Power words
CONFUSE the model rather than help it.


================================================================================
METRIC 2: INCONSISTENCY RATE
================================================================================

What it measures: % of people who get different predictions across styles.
Why it matters: Same experience should = same prediction.

Results:
  DistilBERT: 40.8% inconsistent
  RoBERTa:    93.3% inconsistent

Key insight: RoBERTa gives different answers to 93% of people based on word
choice alone. This is not classification - it's style detection.


================================================================================
METRIC 3: RANK DIFFERENCE
================================================================================

What it measures: How much the model over/underestimates seniority.
Formula: Predicted rank - True rank (Junior=0, Mid=1, Senior=2)
  - Positive = overestimates seniority
  - Negative = underestimates seniority
  - Zero = no bias

Results:
  DistilBERT: Overstated +0.917, Neutral +0.583, Understated +0.550
  RoBERTa:    Overstated +0.925, Neutral +0.733, Understated -0.433

Key insight: Overstated resumes get predicted ~1 FULL LEVEL too high.
A junior with an overstated resume looks like a mid or senior to the model.


================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

SEVERE STYLE BIAS:
- Both models reward confident writing with higher predictions
- 93% of people get different evaluations just by changing word choice
- Overstated juniors get "promoted" to senior by the model

Finetuned models are NOT suitable for fair seniority classification.
