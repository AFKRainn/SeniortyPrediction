                    SUMMARY METRICS EVALUATION GUIDE
================================================================================

PURPOSE
-------
This notebook compares the quality of AI-generated resume summaries against
the original summaries found in the source dataset. It answers: "Are our
generated summaries better than the originals?"


================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

We have two sets of summaries:
- ORIGINAL: Summaries from master_resumes_original.jsonl (the raw dataset)
- GENERATED: Summaries created by our AI model

Many original summaries in resume datasets are poor quality - too short,
generic, or missing entirely. We generated new summaries to improve data
quality for model training.


================================================================================
METRIC 1: WORD COUNT COMPARISON
================================================================================

WHAT IT MEASURES:
Are the summaries a reasonable length?

WHY WE DO IT:
A good summary should be substantial enough to convey the candidate's value
proposition. Very short summaries (< 30 words) are usually incomplete or
generic phrases like "Seeking opportunity."

HOW IT WORKS:
- Split each summary into words
- Count the words
- Compare averages, min, max, and "too short" counts

RESULTS:
                    Original        Generated
  Average:          20 words        60 words
  Min:              1               20
  Max:              109             90
  Too short (<30):  4,685           2

INTERPRETATION:
- Original summaries average only 20 words - barely a sentence
- 4,685 original summaries are under 30 words (essentially useless)
- Generated summaries average 60 words - a proper paragraph
- Only 2 generated summaries are under 30 words
- CONCLUSION: Generated summaries are much more complete


================================================================================
METRIC 2: SEMANTIC SIMILARITY TO RESUME
================================================================================

WHAT IT MEASURES:
How well does the summary capture the actual content of the resume?

WHY WE DO IT:
A good summary should reflect the specific experience, skills, and projects
listed in the resume - not be a generic statement that could apply to anyone.

HOW IT WORKS:

Step 1: Prepare the texts
  - RESUME TEXT: Combine experience + skills + projects from the resume
  - SUMMARY TEXT: The summary being evaluated

Step 2: Convert to embeddings
  - Use SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - This model converts text into a 384-dimensional vector
  - The vector represents the "meaning" of the text
  - Similar meanings = similar vectors

Step 3: Calculate cosine similarity
  - Compare the resume vector vs the summary vector
  - Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors
  - Score range: 0.0 (unrelated) to 1.0 (identical meaning)

WHY SEMANTIC SIMILARITY (not keyword matching):
  - Keyword matching: "Software Engineer" ≠ "Developer" (0% match)
  - Semantic similarity: "Software Engineer" ≈ "Developer" (high match)
  - Semantic understands meaning, not just words

RESULTS:
                    Original        Generated
  Mean Similarity:  0.350           0.660

INTERPRETATION:
- Original summaries: 0.350 similarity
  → Low score suggests they're generic or unrelated to resume content
  → Many may be template phrases not grounded in actual experience

- Generated summaries: 0.660 similarity
  → Much higher - AI actually reads the resume and summarizes it
  → The summary reflects the specific content of that resume

- CONCLUSION: Generated summaries are much more grounded in the actual
  resume content than the originals


================================================================================
VISUALIZATION
================================================================================

The notebook includes two histograms:

1. WORD COUNT DISTRIBUTION
   - Shows the spread of word counts for both summary types
   - Original: Peak near 10-20 words, long tail
   - Generated: Tighter distribution around 50-70 words

2. SEMANTIC SIMILARITY DISTRIBUTION
   - Shows how similar summaries are to their resumes
   - Original: Wide spread, many low values
   - Generated: Clustered higher, more consistently relevant


================================================================================
OVERALL CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The generated summaries are objectively better than the originals:

1. LENGTH: Generated are 3x longer (60 vs 20 words)
2. QUALITY: Generated are 2x more semantically similar (0.66 vs 0.35)
3. COMPLETENESS: Only 2 generated are "too short" vs 4,685 originals

This validates our decision to generate new summaries for the dataset.
