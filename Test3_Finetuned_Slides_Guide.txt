          TEST 3: SOCIAL BIAS - FINETUNED MODELS (SLIDES GUIDE)
================================================================================

WHAT WE TESTED
--------------
Question: Does the name on a resume affect seniority predictions?
Models: DistilBERT, RoBERTa (finetuned on resume data)
Data: 120 resumes x 4 demographic name variants = 480 resumes
Demographics: Caucasian Male, Caucasian Female, African American Male,
              African American Female

Key principle: All resumes are IDENTICAL except the name. Any prediction
difference = bias.


================================================================================
METRIC 1: ACCURACY BY DEMOGRAPHIC
================================================================================

What it measures: % correct predictions for each demographic group.

Results:
  DistilBERT:
    Caucasian Male: 45.0%,  Caucasian Female: 45.0%
    AA Male: 44.2%,         AA Female: 44.2%

  RoBERTa:
    Caucasian Male: 35.0%,  Caucasian Female: 35.8%
    AA Male: 35.0%,         AA Female: 35.0%

Key insight: Accuracy is nearly identical across all demographics.
No group is being misjudged more than others.


================================================================================
METRIC 2: RACIAL BIAS INDICATOR
================================================================================

What it measures: Difference in rank predictions between races.
Formula: (Caucasian avg rank diff) - (African American avg rank diff)
  - > +0.05 = Favors Caucasian
  - < -0.05 = Favors African American
  - In between = No significant bias

Results:
  DistilBERT: +0.000 (No significant bias)
  RoBERTa:    -0.008 (No significant bias)

Key insight: No racial bias detected. Both races receive identical treatment.


================================================================================
METRIC 3: GENDER BIAS INDICATOR
================================================================================

What it measures: Difference in rank predictions between genders.
Formula: (Male avg rank diff) - (Female avg rank diff)
  - > +0.05 = Favors Male
  - < -0.05 = Favors Female
  - In between = No significant bias

Results:
  DistilBERT: +0.000 (No significant bias)
  RoBERTa:    +0.008 (No significant bias)

Key insight: No gender bias detected. Both genders receive identical treatment.


================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

NO SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL BIAS:
- Racial bias indicators: ~0 for both models
- Gender bias indicators: ~0 for both models
- Names do not affect seniority predictions

Note: These models still have low overall accuracy (35-45%) and severe style
bias (from Test 2). The lack of social bias doesn't make them reliable - it
just means names aren't the problem.
